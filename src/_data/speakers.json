In this case, Node doesn’t perform up to mark. This has changed with the release of the worker threads in latest Node versions. We can use threads and write CPU intensive code in Node. This can make Node popular in many other fields of software development, starting from algorithms , AI , complicated computations and more. In this talk I will go over the concept, API and architecture of worker threads.

        "body": "QEWD-JSdb is a new concept for databases in Node.js.  Although it's implemented on top of two incredibly fast, industrial-strength (though little-known) physical database technologies (the Open Source YottaDB and the proprietary IRIS databases), QEWD-JSdb abstracts their underlying hierarchical physical storage as on-disk JavaScript objects, blurring the boundary between what's in-memory and what's on-disk.  \r\n\r\nWith QEWD-JSdb, the database is no longer something that exists on another server, no longer effectively a separate technology that you access via a network connection using its in-built APIs, and which imposes on you a database model over which you have no control.  Let's face it: most mainstream databases are \"one trick ponies\" that model data in one particular way: fine if all your database requirements fit that model, but most likely you'll have circumstances that mean you either end up consuming valuable time fighting that model to fit your needs. or end up having to support multiple databases with all the resulting additional pain, aggravation and maintenance overhead.\r\n\r\nWith QEWD-JSdb, there's none of those restrictions and annoyances: your persistent data and its modelling is in your direct control within your Node.js processes!  As far as you're concerned, you're just dealing with JavaScript objects/JSON, but rather than being in-memory, they happen to be on-disk!\r\n\r\nBut you're not limited to persistent JSON: it's easy to model pretty much any type of database, both NoSQL and Relational/SQL on top of the basic persistent JSON data structures.  In fact, QEWD-JSdb comes with some already created for you to use and/or explore, including:\r\n\r\n- Redis-like Key/Value (actually Key/Object) store\r\n- Redis-like Lists\r\n- Document/JSON database storage\r\n- XML DOM database storage via the DOM API, with XPath querying\r\n- Relational with SQL read/write access\r\n\r\nOnce you're familiar with the basics of QEWD-JSdb, you can create your own custom database model if the built-in models don't meet your needs: no more time wasted fighting the database!\r\n\r\nIt's even possible to simultaneously apply different database models to the same physical QEWD-JSdb data!\r\n\r\nAll sounds too good to be true? Come and find out at Rob's talk on QEWD-JSdb.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nRob Tweed ([@rtweed](https://twitter.com/rtweed)) is a Director of M/Gateway Developments Ltd, and has been part of the LNUG scene since its earliest days - he was one of the speakers at its inaugural meeting, and has given a number of talks over the years, mainly focused on his Node.js-based QEWD technology/platform.  \r\n\r\nRob has several decades of experience, developing and advising on real-world complex, business-critical applications around the world, in sectors such as healthcare IT, financial services and retail systems.  He's specialised in database integration for Web and Internet technologies since the early days in the mid-90s, and has been immersed in Node.js since its earliest days in 2011!\r\n\r\nA keen proponent of Open Source software, you can find all his work (including QEWD-JSdb) at [@robtweed](https://github.com/robtweed)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

But ES10 was released this year with basically zero excitement from anyone. What was in it? And why did nobody care? More importantly though... how can I try out cool new features that are destined for ES11, ES12 or beyond? How do I get my awesome idea into the Javascript spec? And why is it called ES10 and not JS10? While we're at it... what on earth is ECMAScript anyway?!\r\n\r\nThis talk will go over the process that Javascript features go through, it'll help to explain some of the weird history of Javascript and everyone will leave safe in the knowledge that when they have a great idea for the JS spec, they'll know exactly how to get it in.\r\n\r\n# About me\r\n\r\nI'm a software engineer at Applied - a startup striving to make hiring fairer, smarter and easier. I'm a lover of all things Javascript and spend far too much time building weird (read: pointless) things on the web.",

Most features can come later, but if you ever intend to offer a shared editing experience of any kind, you really need to think about it up front.\r\n\r\nAt Threads Styling we were faced with such a prospect when planning their Social Story builder. Having worked with CMSs in the past, we knew the pain of managing document locks with all their edge cases. We also knew that eventually the use case will arise to concurrently edit the document, and if you haven’t planned for it, it is a monumental task.\r\n\r\nBy treating the document as a stream of JSON patch changes from the very beginning, we were able to offer real-time collaborative editing with conflict resolution smoothly handled by an Operational Transformation algorithm. In this talk, Jason will discuss the concepts involved and demonstrate a simple, but working example of a shared document using our open source library.\r\n\r\nBy Jason Green, Principal Developer at Threads Styling - Twitter: @aziraphael\r\n\r\nI confirm my talk is 20 mins long in total.\r\n\r\nI confirm that I will abide by the Code of Conduct",

I'll talk about why we ultimately decided not to use one of the various mono-repo tools, such as Lerna, and ultimately decided to roll our own approach.\r\n\r\n### About me\r\n\r\nI'm an Open Source developer at IBM and the creator of Node-RED.\r\nI can be found online as @knolleary in lots of the usual places.\r\n\r\nI presented about Node-RED at LNUG in its very early days of September 2013, not long after we'd first open sourced it.",

        "body": "While working on large node.js projects, I’ve noticed that there is no clear answer to common questions like “how do I securely store passwords”. I’ve also noticed that all the popular frameworks lack key security features such as CSRF protection and Rate Limiting by default. It’s really easy to get security wrong, and it’s not your fault that this is so difficult.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll present some practical steps you can take to secure your applications, including protecting against some of the most common attack vectors. I’ll also attempt to inspire you to think differently about what the defaults should be when you build new applications and libraries. We can make our code default to security; it doesn’t have to be this way.\r\n\r\nI'm a tech lead at Threads Styling and maintain several large open source projects, such as Pug, [@authentication](https://www.atauthentication.com/) and [@databases](https://www.atdatabases.org/).

I want to talk about one of those. It’s called [Postgraphile](https://www.graphile.org/). It lets you generate a GraphQL API from a schema in a Postgres database.

We recently ran a workshop at CityJs and made sure that everyone walked out of that workshop with an app deployed. In this talk we’ll chat through some of the things that helped us do that (Netlify, serverless functions and Vue) as well as some alternatives (The Serverless framework + lambda etc, firebase and other SPA hosting). The aim? To get everyone to feel empowered to build something fun (and potentially silly).\r\n\r\n## About Us\r\n\r\nHew Ingram\r\nI’m a Full Stack engineer at Applied (a little startup striving to make hiring fairer, smarter and easier - driving forward diversity in companies). I predominantly use JS but dabble with bits of python, PHP and others. Lover of all things Javascript + a big fan of building cool (weird) things, often for the hell of it.\r\n\r\nThomas Ankcorn\r\nI'm a Software Engineer at BAE.

        "body": "## Build your own WebAssembly Compiler \r\n\r\n> For more than 20 years JavaScript has been the only 'native' language of the web. That's all changed with the release of WebAssembly. In the coming years, you'll see people writing web apps in Rust, C#, C++ and all manner of other languages. But just what is WebAssembly? And what’s all the fuss about? WebAssembly is a low-level compilation target, which means that it is unlikely you’ll use it directly. However, as developers and hackers, we love to know how technology works! In this talk, Colin will look at some of the internals of WebAssembly, explore how it works ‘under the hood’, and look at how you can create your own (simple) compiler that targets this runtime.\r\n\r\nAbout me - \r\nI'm a technology enthusiast, working for a consultancy by day, and enjoying myself with open source by night. Here's [my blog](https://blog.scottlogic.com/ceberhardt/) if you want to find out more about me! I'm a keen WebAssembly enthusiast, I run [WebAssembly weekly](https://wasmweekly.news/) and did quite a few 'scene setting' talks on WebAssembly last year.\r\n\r\nFor this talk I want to do something different, delving into the details of what WebAssembly actually is, through the process of creating a compiler that targets WebAssembly.\r\n\r\nI'm actually giving this to at FullStack NYC in May, so would really love the opportunity to do this talk in April as a bit of a rehearsal. It will also help me avoid the usual, last-minute rush to get the talk finished!",

        "body": "# Abstract\r\nOver my last holiday I started a project I am quite enjoying. It is an implementation of the functionality of curl written done purely in node. It presently is nothing close to done, but you can do some basic curl stuff with it (e.g. make multipart form data posts to some url, pipe responses to files, handle http and https proxies (provided they support the connect header) to do requests over to http or https, recursively follow location headers, set headers, etc.). \r\n\r\nThere's presently some vague ftp ideas that are not at all done. \r\n\r\nThe rather bigger challenge I was working on last time I was doing my project was to establish an ssh connection, (which on account of doing everything from scratch will make a number of assumptions about the server it's connecting to).\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to over the next month or so get it all done nicely.\r\n\r\nOverall it's a pleasant way to learn some details of networking, starting to write an ssh client in particular requires manually writing the packets as per the ssh protocol which has been a reasonable education in how that sort of things works. It has also been good for me to appreicate how excellent node is, it really does seem to provide nice apis for everything you want.\r\n\r\n# About me\r\nI'm a former mathematician who over the last 9 or so months has turned programmer, I currently work as a developer mostly working with JavaScript. I mostly like doing algorithms and stuff and have only recently begun to learn the broader aspects of programming. I really love doing things from 'scratch' (in the sense of just using the stuff provided by the language) as I find it quite insightful.",

        "body": "**Testing apps with third-party API integrations**\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will examine strategies and best practices to develop and test node apps that make heavy use of third-party API integrations. As reliance on third-party services becomes more and more prevalent in the node ecosystem, developers need cost-effective, secure, reliable and fast ways to mock these services for both dev/staging environments and testing.\r\n\r\nWe will start with looking at nock, and open-source mocking solution for local development, and move onto unmock which provides mocks-as-a-service of popular APIs.\r\n\r\nThe session will have live coding for both nock and unmock using express to create a simple microservice and jest for testing. It will also present several popular design patterns for isolating and testing third-party integrations as well as strategies for integration testing apps that rely on third-party APIs, including corner-case and error testing.\r\n\r\nPresenters will be myself (Mike Solomon - unmock.io) and I will invite some of our London-based clients to chime in about the importance of testing third-party integrations and the emerging ecosystem of developer sandbox environments for API testing.\r\n\r\nThis is the same talk that we are giving at SFNode (https://github.com/sfnode/sfnode/issues/98). We'd love to bring it to your community, share our learnings and hear your feedback.\r\n\r\n**Bio**\r\nMike Solomon is the founder and CEO of Meeshkan (meeshkan.com), a Helsinki-based DevOps company. A music major at Stanford University, Queen's University Belfast and the University of Florida, Mike has been a guest researcher at the University of Paris VI and has held the post of artistic director of the Ensemble 101 (ensemble101.fr) from 2011 until the present day. While working at the IRCAM as a computer music designer, he fell in love with Machine Learning and founded Meeshkan to ease several DevOps pain points in the ML pipeline. Since then, Meeshkan has expanded to other areas of DevOps, including API testing with unmock (unmock.io).",

In this talk, we’ll take a look at GraphQL and understand what it is, why you might use it, and how it fits in with the existing API landscape. We’ll have a go at writing some simple GraphQL queries together, and hopefully you’ll go away excited about using this awesome tech in your own work & projects.\r\n\r\nAlex ([@somehats](https://twitter.com/somehats)) is a freelance full-stack designer, developer, and educator. When she’s not creating apps, games, and tools for the web, she’s teaching other people how to. Alex has been using GraphQL in production on a number of projects since early 2016, and is super excited about introducing more people to the tech.

User experience is poor because of slow API’s, sales are being missed, performance-linked SEO heuristics are causing a drop in page ranking. Mobile users have all but given up. Operations have reported that a critical Node.js service owned by your team is spinning at 70-100% CPU, and all parts of the application dependent on the service are experiencing intermittent slowdowns or in some cases, complete unavailability. What are you going to do now?\r\n\r\n## Speaker\r\nDavid Mark Clements is a Node.js performance specialist and author of Node Cookbook. He is currently serving as Principal Architect with nearForm. David has been coding, speaking and writing about Node.js since Node 0.4 and has worked with frontend JavaScript for 20 years. Of note among David’s open source contributions is Pino, the fastest Node.js logger available (co-authored with Matteo Collina) and 0x, a JavaScript stack profiling tool. David’s book about Node.js, the aforementioned Node Cookbook, is now in its third edition.",

The [docs](https://tomshacham.github.io/http4js/#intro) are quite descriptive.\r\n\r\nThis talk would be mainly live coding to show the main benefits of using http4js over another node http framework. I've presented to colleagues who are now adopting http4js. I'd love to show the community why I think it's a better way to write web apps, by demonstration! \r\n\r\nI will go through the main selling points: \r\n - in memory testing of your routing (no more slow end-to-end tests)\r\n - immutable Req/Res objects (so harder to smear state around your codebase)\r\n - a simple http client \r\n - zero dependencies\r\n - support for Koa/Express backends (so you can use your favourite middleware)\r\n - nice things that typescript brings (autocompleting, type safety, ... ) \r\n - symmetric client and server type signatures (Request => Promise\\<Response\\> , making proxying a cinch)\r\n\r\nThrough live coding and real examples I will show how simple and sane http4js can be!\r\n\r\n## About me\r\nI'm an Engineer at [Triptease](https://triptease.com/).",

        "body": "Maybe you have heard of Elm, the functional, front-end web language. But why would you as a full stack or backend Javascript developer learn this? Actually, it is the perfect first functional programming language (way friendlier than the others) and could change the way you think about programming Javascript. In particular you will better understand how and why to use TypeScript or Flow.\r\n\r\nThe talk comes in two parts. The first is a quick introduction to Elm via its REPL. We’ll take a look at a few of its key features and lightweight syntax. In the second part we will experience one of Elm’s superpowers: it makes making changes easy. We'll take an existing Elm App and add a new feature, letting the friendly compiler guide us to a working version.\r\n\r\nI'm a polyglot developer currently focusing on React and React Native projects, but I dabble in lots other things. For example I recently made Isometrically: an App for creating 3D-ish graphics, ideal for websites thanks to SVG export/tiny file sizes: https://isometrically.amimetic.co.uk\r\n\r\nI'm [@complexview](https://twitter.com/complexview) on Twitter.",

        "body": "At [EVRYTHNG](http://evrythng.com/) we had to a build a number of Node.js applications that required managing multiple resources in a distributed environment. For example, handling real-time connections to other clouds such as Nest and Honeywell and sending notifications to [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) applets. What if there was a library that handled the allocation and distribution of these resources so developers could focus on the core business logic of their application?\r\n\r\nThe EVRYTHNG distributed resource manager is a Node.js library that solves this problem. Developers don’t need to worry about maintaining real-time connections when new nodes are added to the system or if one of them goes down.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I would demonstrate the resource manager so attendees will see what problems it solves for us at EVRYTHNG. In addition, they will gain an understanding of how we use Node.js at our company and how it helps us scale. Please note that this library is not currently open source but it should be in the next 1-2 months.\r\n\r\nI work as a Technical Lead for EVRYTHNG who provide an IoT platform for businesses around the world. It’s my role to decide on the architecture for various parts of the platform and how we will build these components using Node.js. I’ve been programming in Node for five years.",

I started my experiments in 2015 and have created an app www.Halfchess.com at a slow pace since 2016. \r\n\r\nThe talk is a flash talk and starts with why I got interested in the particular topic; and, the things I built and experiments I did along the way. I also briefly talk about the technologies I used and show how easy it is to hack a chess engine (p4wn) for making your own variations.\r\n\r\n[A bit about you, e.g. current job, twitter handle, etc.]\r\n\r\nI currently work at Mckinsey and am visiting London (from New Delhi) for a quarterly sprint planning meet .

Common bad error handling scenarios\r\n\r\n- Stacktrace lost.\r\n- Code exits without error.\r\n- Generic error messages (`something has failed`).\r\n- ...\r\n\r\n### 2. Exploring possible solutions (examples)\r\n\r\n- Custom errors.\r\n- Formatting error api responses.\r\n- Displaying errors in the UI.\r\n- Examples when using Apollo (GraphQL), React and maybe other tools.\r\n\r\nConclusion: your library/utility/api should be built around its users, and they shouldn't need to read the code to know why something is wrong.\r\n\r\n(I'm really bad with titles 😳)\r\n\r\nI'm a freelance front-end developer, currently working with React and GraphQL.\r\n[twitter](twitter.com/claudiamatosa) | [github](github.com/claudiamatosa)",

Your employer is losing sales opportunities... your employer is losing money!\r\n\r\nBut you don’t lose your cool. You log into your cloud provider and tweak your autoscaling settings. Now the deployment can handle the load spike but with four times the number of servers, which is four times the cost.\r\n\r\nThe next day, you try to analyze what happened and begin to optimize your application to prepare for future load spikes. \r\n\r\nThis talk is a journey into the world of Node.js performance, taking a look at the available tools and optimization techniques inspired by insight gained from glimpsing under the hood of Node and V8.\r\n\r\n### Bio\r\n\r\nMatteo is a code pirate and mad scientist. He spends most of his days programming in Node.js, but in the past he worked with Ruby, Java and Objective-C. In 2014, he defended his Ph.D. thesis titled \"Application Platforms for the Internet of Things\". Now he is a Principal Architect at [nearForm](http://nearform.com), where he consults for the top brands of the world.\r\nMatteo is also the author of the Node.js MQTT Broker, [Mosca](http://mosca.io), the fast logger [Pino](https://github.com/mcollina/pino) and of the [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io) web framework. Matteo is also a member of the Node.js Technical Steering Committee. Matteo spoke at several international conferences: Node.js Interactive, NodeConf.eu, NodeSummit, JSConf.Asia, WebRebels, and JsDay to name a few. He is also co-author of the book \"Node.js Cookbook, Third Edition\" edited by Packt. \r\nIn the summer he loves sailing the _Sirocco_.\r\n\r\nTwitter handle: [@matteocollina](https://twitter.com/matteocollina)\r\n",

Here are a few patterns that we'll cover in the talk:  pub-sub, cron, push-pull, saga and decoupled invocation.\r\n\r\n**About me:**\r\nYan (@theburningmonk) is a polyglot developer and architect, he is a regular speaker at user groups and conferences internationally.

He’s been an architect, lead developer and consultant within a variety of industries, working with organisations ranging from a multi-billion pound corporation to a failed start-up. Scott has spent most of the past 2 years designing and building several serverless architectures and has decided to start sharing some of those experiences.",

        "body": "Node.js apps can run on a multitude of platforms. But when you ship code to production, how can you be sure that it will behave in the same way it did on your local dev machine? Containerisation is one way to mitigate this risk: by building a virtual 'image' which includes the OS, software and source code that your application needs to run, you can ensure a reproducible build you can trust, which runs in the same way in every environment.\r\n\r\nBut containerisation isn't the whole picture. Take the concept of reproducible, declarative builds to its natural conclusion and you get 'container orchestration': a representation of all of your applications and servers and how they relate together. \r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce containerisation with Docker; how you can use it to make your workflows more predictable and your servers more reliable; and using Kubernetes to spin up your applications in the cloud using nothing but YAML files, with monitoring, logging, scaling and networking all taken care of. We'll be looking at some real-world examples, some tips and tricks, advice on developing on your local machine, and some of the more painful discoveries from a few months of deploying to production.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI gave this talk at BristolJS recently, and my slides are here: https://speakerdeck.com/georgecrawford/an-introduction-to-docker-and-kubernetes-for-node-dot-js-developers.

Add your lighting talk to the lineup in the comments on [here](https://github.com/lnug/speakers/issues/116). \r\n\r\n### ⚡️ David Scheiner - Moving on from Mongoose: How a great thing finally cornered us\r\nMongoose has helped us greatly to maintain the integrity of our data against a mongodb database. However, we are not able to share the models we use on our apis anywhere outside those apis. And Mongoose schemas are not shareable, which means we cannot consume them on any other level of our applications. This means either using  conversion plugins, or else writing and maintaining some other solution. In addition, the mongoose models themselves are not shareable, which means even if we solve the schema issue, we still have at least two sets of models to maintain. Finally, we use Typescript, which means ideally we can share schema definitions with that which would allow us to define our entities once and have those definitions propagate to all levels of our applications.  The final part of this presentation will focus on the solution we now intend to adopt as we begin to overhaul our entire architecture in the coming months.\r\n\r\n### ⚡️ James Porter - Node powered static sites with React/GraphQL in minutes\r\nSet up and deploy a Node build system + React/Modern JS + GraphQL static site with Continuous Deployment, domain, HTTPs and more with Gatsby and Netlify. The combination of ease of deployment and access to modern Javascript technologies can be a real game changer for side projects and experiments.",

How do you maintain, develop for, and test a system with extremely high availability on such a scale? It's a bit like juggling twenty fragile glass balls while riding a bicycle. Nevertheless, it's a surprisingly reliable way of delivering the best user experience, and pizza, to our users.\r\n\r\n**More info**\r\nI'll introduce our (complex) infrastructure and will talk a bit more about challenges we have faced and how we solved them.\r\n1. Splitting logic into microservices; changes made into several microservices at once & deployment.\r\n2. Testing our huge products API; running over 20000 unit tests on one microservice, we need to micro-optimise.\r\n3. Making sure it actually works; a system of logging, monitoring, and support\r\n\r\n**About me**\r\nI'm a software engineer at Pizza Hut (contractor), speaker, node and react developer. Previously worked at Red Badger and Time Out. I recently spoke at JeffConf, React London 2017, several meetups.\r\nTwitter handler: [@lithinn](https://twitter.com/lithinn)",

I'm really bad at making graphs and charts and what not, so expect some hands on approach, the talk should cover the very basics of trading and then how to use trading APIs to actually buy and sell stuff online directly from your command line.\r\n\r\nAbout me: The first time i programmed javascript was twenty years ago and since them i have played around with pretty much all the interesting programming languages i have found in front of me just to discover in 2011 i would actually end up doing everything again using only node.js. During this long journey i have worked on backend and frontend applications, interactive games, multiplayer applications, and whatnot. The last few years my big interest turned to be blockchain, cryptocurrencies and trading. After moving to London nearly seven years ago i worked for a few years in a very nice design studio and then later left to create my own little technology company where all those crazy experiments happen.",

        "body": "JSON is becoming the de facto standard format for exchanging data between systems over the Internet.  Its key strengths are its lightweight syntax and its simple data model, which have helped propel it to be the dominant payload format in RESTful web services.\r\n\r\nA lightweight data format deserves a lightweight query and transformation technology that is accessible to non-programmers.  [JSONata](http://jsonata.org) provides that in an open-source module that can be embedded in a web page or used in a node.js app.  Designed with the principle that queries should be simple to write, JSONata has a very shallow learning curve. Yet sophisticated expressions can be quickly mastered by combining the simple navigation syntax with a rich set of operators and functions for extracting, manipulating and aggregating JSON data. \r\n\r\nThis session will introduce you to JSONata and show you how to find buried treasure in your JSON data.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew Coleman is a senior software engineer at IBM specialising in data transformation and application integration.  He is currently building a graphical data mapper for [integrating cloud based services](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibm-app-connect).\r\n\r\nAndrew is the Chair of the [W3C XML Query Working Group](https://www.w3.org/XML/2015/05/query-charter.html) responsible for developing the [XPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/) and [XQuery](https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31/) family of specifications.  He has borrowed heavily on the experience gained from this to create the [JSONata](http://jsonata.org) query and transformation language for JSON.",

        "body": "## Abstract\r\nMost likely you are choosing Node.js because it has the reputation to be super-fast, easy to use and you heard a lot of success stories at meetups and conferences. Sure you did performance and scalability tests which confirmed that your decision was correct to go with Node.js. \r\n\r\nWhat Daniel has seen is that in enterprise environments Node.js often acts as the (often microservice based) gluing tier that connects legacy services to modern offerings like mobile apps or your HTML5 SPA (Single Page Apps) via a REST API Layer. \r\n\r\nThis means that once you integrate your application into the company infrastructure, connect it to internal & external services and go productive you may be the first person to be blamed because \"the website is slow\" or even better \"something broke – there is an error we have not seen before\". But who knows if in fact a service consumed or brokered by Node or a database is slow?  In this session Daniel will cover - how to trace down problems inside Node - the challenges operations is facing in todays highly heterogeneous applications - how to protect the boundaries of your service to pinpoint problems in other tiers - new tracing features in upcoming versions of Node.\r\n\r\n## Bio\r\nPragmatic fullstack engineer from BGP to AJAX. Speaker, mentor and course author. I am leading the Node.js technology efforts of Dynatrace. Member of Node.js Diagnostics WG. Let's chat about the old days, todays cutting edge technologies, (web) performance ... you name it.\r\n\r\n[@dkhan](https://twitter.com/dkhan) on twitter\r\n\r\n",

It’s all looking good, but now what?\n\nRunning `Docker` on your local box is one thing, but maintaining containers in production is a whole other ballgame. So during this talk, I’ll show you the REAL wild world of Docker in production. With the added benefit of talking to and observing how over 900 of our customers have been using Docker in production for Node, I’ll be presenting some of these data points and sharing our observations on how to get it right. \n\nMy aim? I want to turn the conversation on its head and dispel some of the ‘silver bullet’ assumptions flying around by taking an inside-out approach to building with Docker. The idea is to provide you with a framework for how to get your code into containers, streamline the Docker build flow and avoid common pitfalls when moving from dev to live environments.\n\nBecause remember, Docker will NOT, and I repeat, will not solve your bad dev and ops behaviours. So don’t end up with a ‘hot mess’ (more on that later).\n\n**Daniël van Gils** is a polyglot developer advocate at [Cloud 66](https://www.cloud66.com).

        "body": "**Abstract**\n\nFlow is a static type checker for JavaScript (an otherwise dynamically-typed language). You can think of it as a productivity tool that catches common errors _before_ they run. \n\nTake the infamous \"'Undefined' is not a function\" error as an example. When writing vanilla JavaScript, you would have to wait until runtime to receive this arduous error. Flow - on the other hand - integrates with your favorite editor and analyzes the correctness of your code as you write it. If you were to reference a non-existent function, Flow would not only tell you immediately but also provide additional context that makes the error easier to fix.\n\nWhilst Flow is predominantly used with front-end technologies like React, I have been using it with great success for my Node.js projects and in this talk, I'll not only show you how to get up and running with Flow, I'll also share my experience with you. I'll also take a moment at the end of my talk to touch on the differences between Flow and TypeScript.\n\n**Alex Booker**\n\nAlex Booker is a Developer Advocate at [Pusher](https://pusher.com/). There, he spends his time learning and writing about interesting, emerging technologies, and representing Pusher at events around the world.

        "body": "Everyone talks about the Internet of Things, but the lack of interoperability in the IoT today means what we really have is a series of isolated \"Intranets of Things\". This fragmentation and the high costs of integration required to overcome it, shows that we're failing to realize the full potential of the IoT.\n\nJust like the Internet needed the Web to become successful, the Internet of Things needs an application layer to truly blossom. The Web of Things (WoT) approach offers a compelling solution to this problem. The core of the Web of Things (http://webofthings.org) approach is quite simple: why don't we re-use Web standards to build the APIs of Things?\n\nIn this talk I'd like to introduce a book we just published at Manning press (http://book.webofthings.io) on how to build an open IoT using Web technologies. The talk will look at the layers of integration to the Web, from IoT networks, to Web APIs, the semantic Web and the programmable Web all of this illustrated with Node examples (as the book is based on Node.js code for the Raspberry Pi).\n\nAbout me:\nTwitter: @domguinard and @webofthings\nCTO and co-founder @EVRYTHNG\nhttp://dom.guinard.org\n",

If we have a couple shorter than 20 mins we could possibly squeeze you all in. \n\nFailing that - we will discuss a plan among the @lnug/organisers and let you know - things may need to get shuffled!\n\nBest, \n@admataz\n",

Irrespective of platform our current toolchains are very much oriented around the construction of monolithic application stacks and are unwieldy and cumbersome when applied to micro-service based systems. This talk will demonstrate a dynamic and responsive developer toolchain for micro-services implemented in and targeting node.js, that is more aligned with this architectural style. This talk will cover the tools that nearForm use to develop micro-services in the wild, something we've discovered and iterated on over the last three years.\n\n**Bio**\nPeter Elger is Director of Engineering with nearForm, a Node.js consultancy - http://nearform.com.\nFormerly a physicist working on the JET nuclear fusion research project, Peter has been co-founder \nand CTO of two companies prior to nearForm and holds degrees in theoretical physics and computer science.

The talk would be rather technology agnostic, although node is one of the technologies I have had the pleasure of working with (and had to get to grips with very rapidly during a craft-a-thon), it would be much more based around trying to let people know about the trials and tribulations of the Makers Academy student journey.\n\nI'm Michael, a junior developer who's just finished here at Makers\nYou can learn a little more about me at [michaellennox.me/blog](http://www.michaellennox.me/blog/)\n",

You’re introducing someone else’s code into your system, often with little or no scrutiny. Each component may have vulnerabilities (~14% of them do!), may be compromised, or even be outright malicious. Multiply that risk by hundreds of dependencies, and you have a recipe for disaster.\n\nIn this talk we’ll show how you can mitigate this risk without losing productivity. We’ll share more data more about the risk; show how to find & fix known vulnerabilities in these dependencies; discuss how to prioritize the ones worthy of manual inspection & suggest what to monitor in production. \n",

With all of the different implementations fighting for recognition, to first time users and abusers it can seem overly complicated.\n\nRedux is one Flux framework which has gained a lot of traction recently, thanks to its novel take on the architecture (vastly simpler than Facebooks sample implementation, for instance) and neat debugging features.\n\nThis talk can show the differences between Redux's approach and more 'traditional' Flux architectures, running over its benefits for developers. It will also briefly explain the difference between Flux applications and other MVC implementations, for anyone curious and unfamiliar.\n",

We've all learnt the lesson that other types of databases are better suited for certain problems, be it document store, key-value or column based. Graph databases on the other hand have been on the peripheral for me and no doubt many others. Even after reading Seven Databases in Seven Weeks, I still didn't quite get the point of graph DBs.\n\nSince looking into them, I now see that they could well nail down a lot of problems we all encounter and I think I'd like to talk about what we're using OrientDB for and highlight the potential they have in future development. \n",

Less how to use these practices, more how to select and use them effectively.\n\nJust using these tools on their own can lead to unnecessary complexity that can be hard to understand or avoid. So let’s set aside discussions of the language syntax or capabilities and focus on what is important - delivering value to the customer.\n\nThis presentation will show how BDD practices can be applied to the different contexts of developing features through a multi-layer stack whilst smoothing the communication, providing detailed direction and showing the value for business owners and developers alike. The result is a feature that meets the business owner’s expectations with happy side effects such as the code being clean, well designed, understandable, fully tested and documented.\n",

ES2015 also introduced _generator functions_, which make writing arbitrary iterators a lot easier and less boilerplatey.\n\nBut generators aren't just for making simple iterators over data structures. Because they're bidirectional—they don't only produce output, they can also take input—they're actually _coroutines_, which means there's no end to the sort of fun you can apply them to. We're going to explore how we can use them to make asynchronous programming in JavaScript a lot more elegant—to chart a path out of callback hell. And then we're going to take a look at what we've really discovered: one of the most fearsome mysteries of computer science, suddenly laid bare before us.\n",

Do you really need to host your own Node.js service to run this small snippet of backend logic?\n\nIn this talk I will take a hard look at the role of the backend in modern applications. I will introduce the concept of a [webtask](https://webtask.io) - a lightweight representation of backend logic that can safely be embedded in a client application. I will show how you can use modern container technologies based on CoreOS and Docker to build a generic, multi-tenant runtime for securely executing webtasks directly from a mobile or HTML5 application. You don’t need a backend to run backend code.\n\nThis talk is based on lessons learned when building the Node.js sandboxing technology for internal use in our core operations at Auth0.\n\nFind out more:\n[Webtask concepts](http://tomasz.janczuk.org/2015/04/rethinking-backend-with-webtasks.html)\n[Webtask CLI](https://github.com/auth0/wt-cli)\n[Webtask playground](https://webtask.io)\n[Webtask technology](https://medium.com/aws-activate-startup-blog/sandboxing-code-in-the-era-of-containers-294edb3a674)\n",

Only a few short years ago, the development world were excited about WebRTC and proclaiming how awesome it was. \n\nYou might have played with the technology a couple of years ago, only to find the extra infrastructure requirements were painful to implement and poorly documented. This probably left a bitter taste in your mouth, especially when things went wrong.\n\nThose in the industry have been working hard to sweeten the deal again - efforts have been made to bring WebRTC into the mainstream and as a result the technology is experiencing a rebirth. Thanks to those who have remained dedicated to improving the situation for those around them, WebRTC is finally starting to fulfil the original expectations that were had of it. Both the technology and the support networks have been built up to make experimenting with it again a pleasure, not a pain.\n\nWebRTC has grown up; in this talk you will learn how far along the tech has come, its current capabilities, the amazing things that people are starting to do with it, and how simple getting started with the new toolsets available.\n",

TypeScript is powerful though, rapidly gaining momentum, and has a lot more to offer than just JS + classes.

        "body": "Writing front-end code today is very challenging when you have to be resilient and robust in a big corporation. Working on a website that involves dozens of engineers based in three different continents, I learned that the complexity lies not only within the code itself. Allowing people to develop new features and deploy the code multiple times a day, keeping it up and running, is hard to achieve: we want small teams to be independent and not to interfere each other, in order to be quick and happy, but we also want to optimise cooperation when it is needed.\n\nIn the front-end world components are very small units of code providing application functionality that are all connected in order to become a web-site.\n\nDuring this talk I’m going to speak about how we tried to approach to components at OpenTable. After breaking our monolithic back-end into smaller parts, we tried to break the front-end into smaller parts too, called micro-sites. Then, following the SOA principles, we tried to elevate components as services, in order to make engineers able to create and consume them via clear and well-defined contracts and interfaces. This allowed us to put in place the infrastructure to optimise testing and to have hundreds of changes live every day without conflicts. The result is OpenComponents, a framework that we recently open-sourced.\n\nReferences:\nhttp://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2015/02/09/dismantling-the-monolith-microsites-at-opentable/\nhttps://github.com/opentable/oc\n",

The talk would be axed on two main points:\n- Make a technology accessible to other developers.

Along came gulp, the wonderful streaming pipeline, but the people saw that it was flawed, being built around `1:1` operations (disallowing nice n:1 stuff such as concatenation of streams together with their source maps).\n\nThen came plumber, broccoli, gobble, and metalsmith, all with unique selling points yet all having drawbacks not found in grunt and/or gulp.\n\nIt was time for a new asset pipeline to be born out of the pain of trying to find the holy grail of asset pipelines. It was time to write it using functional reactive programming, ES6 and a geekgasm of buzz-words to seduce the JavaScript community. It was time for a bullshit sensationalised lnug talk abstract. Yes, it's time to sigh. [sighjs](https://github.com/sighjs/sigh).\n\nIn this talk I will describe the issues with existing asset pipelines (read: trash all the competition) and describe how sighjs improves upon the state of the art (read: gloriously inflate my ego).\n\nThis talk will last around 10 minutes long and it will be a little surreal. Here is [one of my other talks at HNN](https://vimeo.com/31535266j).\n",

        "body": "On February 20th the first release candidate of the 6th edition of the ECMAScript specification (ECMAScript 2015 as it is now officially known) was released. The language is rapidly stabilising and the new features are slowly but surely making their way into the existing JavaScript engines. Unfortunately, it will still be a while before we're able to write ES6 code and have it run natively in either browsers or Node and io.js. Thankfully TC39 (the group responsible for the development of the ECMAScript specification) put a lot of effort into ensuring backwards compatibility so it is possible to use a large and growing proportion of ES6 today.\n\nThis talk will look into some of the technologies and techniques that can be used to write, publish and deploy ES6 code today, without having to wait until the engines catch up. We'll explore source-to-source compilation, standard library polyfills, publishing modules written in ES6 to npm and the consumption of those modules by existing ES5 and new ES6 code.\n",

While this poses a lot of opportunities for us to work together and build better software, it also comes with problems we as developers have to face: Which package should I now choose? How do I use it in my app? What input does it expect? etc. Making a multitude of these simple decision drains a lot of our energy - more than you might even think initially. Imagine now `npm install` and you are ready to go. You installed your addon, you already know what to expect and it hooks itself up into your app.\n\nThis is the philosophy behind convention-over-configuration: having a standard we all work with to automate mundane decisions. So we can focus on making our software better.\n\n*Source: http://www.modulecounts.com/\n",

With a strong emphasis on how JavaScript code can be done beautiful and maintainable, this talk explains how to write very readable and testable code. At eBay we love to have our code clean, so we’ll use some examples of eBay’s code during this presentation.\n\nWe’ll touch topics on how functional can intersect with object oriented programming to decrease the learning curve to your code. Or how choosing the correct data structures is more important than ever to guarantee optimal performance. \n\nAll of this in a framework agnostic way, so that it is easy to take home and apply to your projects with ease. \n\nHopefully after you have attended this talk you will code cleaner.\n\nTopics covered:\n\nCode readability\nFunctional JS\nObject Oriented JS\nUnit Testing\nCode structuring\n",

It will then deep dive into how the nitty gritty of the compiler is implemented, this will include some discussion of the many other modules that jade depends on.  I will then take the audience on a tour of a couple of my favourite spinoffs of jade.  Finally, I will end with a description of how we have built a community around the jade project that is capable of achieving far more than I could on my own.\n\nAny thoughts on this are welcome.  I think it would be a relatively long talk, maybe 1 hour.\n",

Adding focus to how the usage of promises and futures influences coding styles and architectural decisions.\n\nTopics covered:\n- Quick JS `Promises/A+` overview\n- Reference to Dart `Futures`\n- Reference to Java `Futures` and Java8 `CompletableFuture`\n- How promises tend to use the Monad design pattern (examples in JS)\n- Why unit testing is even more important when working with promises (examples in JS)\n- Using promises to abstract from synch/asynch behavior, and be more reactive.\n",

        "body": "Hi LNUG,\n\nI would be very interested in doing a talk.\n\nI have been working on a project for many months, which is an attempt to make it easier to develop apps (web or phonegap) that can work offline but also Synchronize data back up to the server when an Internet connection becomes available. This is a pretty difficult problem to solve, particularly in a way which is not tied to any particular application logic.\n\nThe guts of the project is basically an asynchronous versioning LocalStorage written in vanilla JavaScript so it is super portable and reusable ( see https://github.com/forbesmyester/SyncIt ).\n\nI have also started other projects that are loosely coupled to SyncIt for the server component and a network monitoring / communication of changes. See https://github.com/forbesmyester/SyncItControl and https://github.com/forbesmyester/syncit-server.\n\nThere is of course always more to do, but it is now feature complete and has a base project ( https://github.com/forbesmyester/SyncItBootstrap ) so it is easy to get an App started. There is even a TodoMVC example ( https://github.com/forbesmyester/SyncItBootstrap/tree/todomvc / http://teud.eu )... The blocks at the top are the synchronization status.\n\nIt is all Open Source and I am basically now transitioning from development to trying to get the word out about it as I think it could be really useful for lots of people. Doing a talk at LNUG would be an amazing start to my promotion efforts.\n\nI would talk about:\n- The reasons it is a non trivial problem, such as network latency and being offline.\n- Trying to keep it as a library and not coupled to jQuery or nearly anything else.\n- Why it is essential to have a form of version control for detecting conflicts.\n- The choice to trigger the app developers handler for conflicts instead of trying to write a universal one.\n- Lastly I would talk about the loosely coupled but complementary projects such as the server and communication control component.\n- A demo, or perhaps a few throughout to aid visualisation of what is happening...\n\nYou can contact me as @forbesmyester on Twitter or through the email on my GitHub account.\n\nThanks\n\nMatt Forrester\n",
