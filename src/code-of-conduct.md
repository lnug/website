# Code Of Conduct

LNUG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for
everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any
form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled
from the meetup at the discretion of the organisers.

This code of conduct applies to attendees, speakers, and organisers at
the monthly meetups and in related social events. This includes slide
decks and listings on the job board.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

The following behaviour is considered unacceptable and constitutes
harassment:

-   Offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and
    expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
    body size, race, religion.
-   Sexual images in public spaces.
-   Deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography
    or recording.
-   Sustained disruption of talks or other events.
-   Inappropriate physical contact.
-   Unwelcome sexual attention.
-   Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
    comply immediately.

## Consequences Of Unacceptable Behaviour


If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organisers
may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the
offender or expulsion from the meetup.

## Reporting


If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please contact one of the organisers
immediately.

Meetup organisers will also be happy to help participants contact local

feel safe for the duration of the meetup. **We value your attendance.**
