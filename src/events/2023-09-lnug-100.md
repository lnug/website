  - title: "Crafting Robust APIs with TypeScript: A Hands-On Approach"
    description: |
        Immerse yourself in a hands-on exploration of crafting robust, self-documenting, and efficient APIs with TypeScript. This dynamic session urges a rethink of conventional API development, focusing on how TypeScript's static typing can help develop accurate and consistent APIs - making impossible scenarios impossible.

        We'll untangle a common problem into an intuitive API, emphasizing on clear API signatures to prevent error scenarios instead of just handling them. We'll illustrate how TypeScript's features can diminish potential failures, resulting in APIs that are easier to use, inherently self-describing, and highly reliable.

        Tailored for developers with a basic understanding of APIs and typed languages, this session is also an invitation for anyone keen on writing quality code to delve deeper into effective API design. While familiarity with TypeScript is beneficial, it's not a prerequisite - we'll navigate the learning curve together.

        By the end of this talk, you'll walk away with fresh insights on how to leverage TypeScript to improve API design, making them more robust and user-friendly. Even if you find yourself disagreeing with the viewpoints presented, you'll undoubtedly emerge with a more thoughtful approach to API design. Ready to roll up your sleeves and redefine robust API design? Let's embark on this hands-on journey together, TypeScript style!
