    description: |
        The reason I created Effect in the first place was to develop production grade backends in TypeScript targeting Node.js, today I'll be showing the result! In this talk we will be looking at a live demo & coding session where we will develop an API server and client from scratch using Effect and Node.js that includes features such as OpenAPI spec generation, OpenTelemetry, Metrics and much more.

        I am the author of Effect and the CEO of Effectful Technologies, my twitter is [@MichaelArnaldi](https://x.com/MichaelArnaldi)
