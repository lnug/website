  - title: "Learn the platform with svelte"
    description: |
        Svelte is a frontend framework but despite that thanks to svelte-kit and the general philosophy behind svelte it's a great tool to get started in web dev because while learning svelte you can easily learn how the web platform works, and now with svelte-kit you can learn node too!

        I'm Paolo Ricciuti, i work as a full stack developer at Main matter and I'm a svelte lover (and also an official svelte ambassador).

  - title: "WebRTC: Why Art Thou Such A PITA?"
    description: |
        The history and status of WebRTC, how it's still terribly unwieldy for people to get started with - even after a decade since it's release, and how we can use Node.js to build P2P applications at scale with a little bit of prodding.
