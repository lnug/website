  - title: "Destroying Client-Server Barriers using TypeScript"
    description: |
        Could you access the Prisma client on the frontend - without revealing any environment variables? This talk goes into my experimentation with Object proxies and websockets, allowing a developer to access server-side objects on the client, with type-safety.

        I'll walk through how the proxying works, the type-safety features, and everything else which makes the library works. https://rocketrpc.com

         Use Cases:
        - Define a type-safe API layer on the backend
        - Share objects like ORM clients with the frontend 

        I'm a frontend developer at Meta London, with an extreme interest in open source and building web apps for the future. I have 4 years of professional experience in total, but have been contributing via articles and open-source projects since 2016. You can find me on Twitter @thewritingdev.
