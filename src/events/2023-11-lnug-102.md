  - title: "The next stage of serverless is personal"
    description: |
        Serverless changed the world by bringing on-demand compute to everyone across the planet, but with tradeoffs, making certain architectures like multiplayer and collaboration much harder to implement. The next evolution aims to fix these problems, and is available today. In this talk we'll talk about the details of this evolution, and see what new capabilities and tradeoffs arise. 

        Sunil Pai is the founder of [PartyKit](https://twitter.com/partykit_io), an open source platform for building  real-time, collaborative, multiplayer apps. You can find him at [@threepointone](https://twitter.com/threepointone/) and [@partykit_io](https://twitter.com/partykit_io)

  - title: "Suspend Server Side Request Waterfalls"
    description: |
        Moving your app to a server side rendered approach has performance pitfalls people are not talking about enough. 

        The server side request waterfall blocks page loads and can make the UX bad. But what can we do other than move data fetching back to the client? 

        Streams, WebStandards, and Transfer-Encoding: Chunked. 

        We are going to break down how these tools work and and why we would use them and finally I am going to show how [HonoJS](https://github.com/honojs/hono) helps package up these tools to provide an easy-to-use and familiar API to solve this problem.

        I work at [Baselime](https://baselime.io) on distributed tracing and observability for Node.JS applications and Occasionally help organise LNUG.
