  - title: '‚ö° The Great Escape: Escaping the Legacy Code Trap'
    description: "In this talk, the Integrations team at Beamery shares how we tackled and overhauled a complex legacy system comprising 72 serverless functions. By adopting modern technologies, we not only improved performance and scalability but also significantly enhanced the developer experience. We‚Äôll dive into the strategies we used to break down the system, the challenges we faced during the migration, and the innovative solutions that helped us achieve success.

  - title: 'GenAI wrote this talk: custom copilots for an AI-first world'
    description: "In a world rapidly shifting to an AI-first mindset, how can engineers bridge the gap between existing APIs and the GenAI tools used by employees everyday, such as Microsoft Copilot? In this talk Steph will demonstrate how to extend MS Teams Copilot with custom API Plugins, empowering users to chat with your data in the same way they'd chat with any other LLM. The catch? She'll be using her own custom Microsoft Copilot to help her deliver the talk!\r\n\r\nStephanie Shaw is an Engineering Manager at Beamery, where she leads an R&D team exploring the possibilities of generative AI within Beamery's industry-leading Talent Lifecycle Management platform.

  - title: Performant Architecture for a Fast Gen AI User Experience
    description: "More and more developers are being asked to build Generative AI experiences into their web applications everywhere. However, the user's experience with Generative AI can sometimes be slow and frustrating. It‚Äôs been years since we would gladly wait over 10 seconds for a response to anything online. As AI processing gets faster, there are new limiting factors that could be negatively affecting your AI user experience.
    \n\n
    In this talk, we will cover different ways to minimise laggy experiences in web applications when interacting with third-party Generative AI tools. We‚Äôll be using a practical demonstration to show how you can reduce latency as we build one of my favourite sci fi gadgets, the babel fish.
