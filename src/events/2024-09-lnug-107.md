  - title: "Browser File Access APIs to Share Local Capabilities and Data Between Devices"
    description: |
        Modern browsers have powerful APIs for accessing local files. In this talk, we'll explore these capabilities and how we can combine them with peer-to-peer networking to share capabilities between devices and push edge compute further down to local devices.

        Topics covered:
        - File System Access
        - CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)
        - Origin Private File System
        - WebRTC
        - Edge compute

  - title: "Streaming Magic: Unleashing the Power of Node.js Streams for Data Processing"
    description: |
        NodeJS provides a brilliant built-in "stream" module for working with data streams. It is well suited for processing large data files and its promises API super-charges working with async iterables, such as paginating items from an API. This talk will feature a real time coding demo of how I've written simple data processing scripts for quick analysis at work, rapidly and effectively crafted using the¬†`node:stream/promises`¬†module. I'll also present some bonus developer tips on other use cases for the highly flexible Readable stream API.

        Brian Evans is a full stack software engineer working in London using Javascript/Typescript.
