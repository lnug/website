  - title: "Pushing the Edge: Browser APIs and P2P Networking for Local Device Empowerment"
    description: |
        Modern browsers have powerful APIs for accessing local files. In this talk, we'll explore these capabilities and how we can combine them with peer-to-peer networking to share capabilities between devices and push edge compute further down to local devices.

        Topics covered:
        - File System Access
        - CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)
        - Origin Private File System
        - WebRTC
        - Edge compute

        Ben Foxall leads the Robot Web team at Wayve, bringing extensive experience in cutting-edge web technologies and their applications in robotics and edge computing.

  - title: "Streaming Magic: Unleashing the Power of Node.js Streams for Data Processing"
    description: |
        Dive into the world of Node.js streams with Brian Evans as he demonstrates the brilliance of the built-in "stream" module for working with data streams. Perfect for processing large data files, the promises API supercharges your work with async iterables, such as paginating items from an API.

        This talk will feature a real-time coding demo showcasing how to write simple yet effective data processing scripts for quick analysis using the `node:stream/promises` module. Brian will also share bonus developer tips on other use cases for the highly flexible Readable stream API.

        Brian Evans is a full stack software engineer working in London, specializing in Javascript/Typescript development.
