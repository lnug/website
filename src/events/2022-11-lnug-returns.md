  - title: "Skip the CRUD: Rapid API development with Platformatic DB and Fastify"
    description: |
      Building an API typically starts with designing the API interface, integrating a database library, wiring up CRUD endpoints, adding request validation, documenting the API ‚Äî the list goes on! It‚Äôs a lot of repetitive and time consuming work. I‚Äôll show you how Platformatic DB enables you to you rapidly develop REST and GraphQL APIs with Node.js, helping you skip all of that painful groundwork. We‚Äôll also explore how the Fastify framework it‚Äôs built on top of allows you to add custom functionality with familiar tools.

  - title: "JavaScript Runtimes on AWS Lambda"
    description: |
      Node.js is one of the key runtimes to develop applications on AWS Lambda. It was announced 13 years ago and is now considered to be  [boring technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)  by many. But over the past few years, a few newer JavaScript runtimes have emerged, to solve some of the issues with Node.js.
      In this talk, we will walk through a few of the newer JavaScript runtimes, and do a comparison of both the developer experience and their performance when deployed on AWS Lambda.
