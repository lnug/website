        In this talk, I talk through my process of messing with the Bereal native app to post custom images by intercepting Firebase file upload requests. this talk is inspired by my blog post on the subject. Through the presentation, I reflect on security considerations for building native apps, especially security concerns associated with Firebase.

        Oscar is a Senior fullstack Typescript dev, working for a women's fertility med-tech startup (Hertility). I also contract in Antarctica over the winter to help scientists with experiments.
