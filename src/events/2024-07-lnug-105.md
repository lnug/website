  - title: "Type-safe app configuration: a powerful, emerging way to accelerate product development"
    description: |
        Everyone has heard of feature flags: boolean switches in your code that you can flip at runtime for different users, environments, etc. But they are just one part of a much broader best practice called ‚Äúapplication configuration‚Äù. Big tech companies like Meta and Google have internal tools for structured, type-safe app configuration that help them accelerate development of products and backend services. This talk dives into what app configuration is and how it can empower your whole team to move faster, including your nontechnical colleagues.

        Miraan is the founder at Hypertune. He was previously at Meta where he led teams across frontend, mobile, backend and machine learning.

  - title: "Lessons Learned Building an AI CLI in 2024"
    description: |
        How is an AI-powered CLI which allows you to confidently write complex commands and queries in your CLI. This talk goes into how "How" was built, talking about the no-build CLI deployment process, type-safety, cross-OS compatibility, and more!

        I'm a software engineer at RocketConnect, like to host meetups and write code in my spare time and also run!
