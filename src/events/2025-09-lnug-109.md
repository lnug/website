  - title: Turning Chaos into Control with Cloudflare on Our Hybrid Node.js Stack
    description: >-
      This is our real-world story of running Node.js across GCP Cloud Functions,
      Cloud Run, and Kubernetes ‚Äî and the chaos that came with it. Multiple entry
      points, inconsistent security, and a wide attack surface made things messy.


      In just 20 minutes, I‚Äôll share the long journey of putting it all behind
      Cloudflare‚Äôs edge with Zero Trust, WAF, load balancing, GCP Cloud Armor, and
      image optimization. You‚Äôll hear lessons, pitfalls, and practical takeaways
      from securing a complex Node.js platform at scale for one of the biggest
      e-commerce businesses in London.

  - title: Building MCP servers with Node.js
    description: >-
      MCP (Model Context Protocol) helps to feed more data to an LLM. For example,
      it can make an LLM search through your Google Drive. It does not stop at
      reading data, you can even instruct an LLM to create a ticket in your
      project management system. But why stop there? You can also use MCP to
      connect to a Phillips Hue light and let an LLM control the colour of the
      light in your room while you‚Äôre talking to it.


      In this talk we‚Äôre going to wrap up the sleeves and build our very own MCP
      server with [Node.js.](http://node.js./) So expect a lot of live coding!

      I have just woken from a deep, long sleep. What have I missed in the world
      of node.js?
    description: >-
      11 months, no LNUG.  What have we been doing with all this time? How have
      you filled the 4th Wednesday of every month? 


      This lightning talk will be a quick, and at times irreverent tour of what's
      happened in the node.js universe and beyond since last October. A chance for
      me to catch up. Educate me. We will review and (dis)agree on what is good
      and bad with new released features and innovations in the ecosystem, and we
      will squint toward the future.  We'll open the floor to suggestions and ad
      hoc votes, and I guess  we'll probably split the audience down the middle
      between the cheerleaders and the naysayers on the new landscape of agentic
      workflows that will make us either superhuman or subject us to robotic
      serfdom.  


      Is node.js still fun anymore? 


      It's great to be back - I'm looking forward to seeing you again.

      ### about me

      - By day I am a Technical Lead at [Nearform](https://nearform.com) where I
      view node.js development through binoculars and help guide my team with a
      megaphone from my vantage point on the hill. 

      - By night I am @admataz, one of the LNUG organisers responsible for this
      delay to our meetup programme, among other things.
