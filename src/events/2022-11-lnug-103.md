        Master the Monorepo with Ahmed Elsakaan.
        Monorepos are a fundamental aspect of many codebases, however to get the most out of this architecture, we need to find ways to streamline the process of creating and maintaining them so that we eventually don't end up in config hell, broken builds and pipelines. In this talk I will aim to introduce the concept of monorepos, why are they used and what benefits they try to accomplish and many tips in ways to work in monorepos to eventually get yourself at a place where they make your entire team more productive.


        My name is Ahmed Elsakaan, I'm currently a Software Engineer at Parameta Solutions. I am passionate about anything to do with the web, mostly web tooling, typescript, react and of course, monorepos. I built https://orbitkit.dev to act as a solid foundation to monorepo codebases and a source of guidance to those who want a reference of doing things in monorepos. My twitter handle is ixahmedxii.
