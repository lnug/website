> "A friendly meetup for people using node.js for fun or profit."

LNUG is London's **node.js** user group. We have been running regular [monthly meetups since September 2011](/archive) and over the years we have hosted talks by local developers and speakers from all over the world.

LNUG is run and organised by London developers. Our commitment is to represent London's diverse community, to welcome the wider global node.js community to our busy city, and to provide a platform for node.js developers - local rising stars, newbies and experts alike - to share their expertise and network.

We are proud to have been a regular calendar event for locals and to those passing through London - and to be the go-to community event for node.js developers in London.
