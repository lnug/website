# Update

This site can be updated by running:

```
  npm run build
```

build pulls in the speakers from the github issues and updates the json files.

It then generates the html for the index and archive.html files.

Once you have built the site confirm it works locally before pushing to master as that will deploy the site.

Check the package.json file for a full list of commands you can run.

###For the image-gallery
For the image-gallery, is is necessary to manually update the file data/gallery.json (this is an interim solution for now Feb/2016)
When running the command `npm run build` it will read the contents from that file and create the markup for the image-gallery page.
The 3 random images on the home page are inserted there using Javascript with every page refresh


###To create thumbnails
To create **thumbnails** just drop your pics inside folder **gallery** and then run `npm run photos`
It will create a 350x350 thumbnail for every pic and store it inside **gallery/thumbnails**.

To run the update you need permission to execute the bin directory.

  chmod 775 ./bin/*
